I do not have a script to do this modification to the tcl script.

Replace the set directory path for the new project with and the new project create function with this 

# Create project
create_project ${_xil_proj_name_} $orig_proj_dir -part xc7z020clg400-1

# Set the directory path for the new project
set proj_dir "[file normalize "$origin_dir/../work_folder"]"



You need to find the line stating "# Set 'sources_1' fileset object"

Then you need to add this line directly above it.

The locations below may change between runs. Make sure to match the location given in step 2 of the imports list.

#Copy the design_1_wrapper.v to its storage location
file mkdir ./../work_folder/CAERUS_V4.srcs/sources_1/bd/design_1/hdl/
file copy $origin_dir/../wrapper/design_1_wrapper.v ${origin_dir}/../work_folder/CAERUS_V4.srcs/sources_1/bd/design_1/hdl/design_1_wrapper.v

Before uploading project, make sure to run the prepare file shell script.
